# Data Mining Homework 1

## Homework Overview

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow**: For neural network implementations.
- **PyTorch**: For deep learning tasks.

### Main Sections:
1. **Reading Libraries**: The initial part of the notebook includes the necessary libraries to perform data mining tasks such as preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
   
2. **Dataset Loading**: Data is loaded for further analysis, and various preprocessing techniques are applied, such as normalization and feature scaling.
   
3. **Model Implementation**: The notebook guides you through implementing and testing different machine learning models. Additional exercises and tasks are marked to ensure that the key aspects of data mining are covered.

4. **Visualization**: Various plots and charts are used to visualize the relationships in the data.

## How to Run the Notebook
