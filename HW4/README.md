# Data Mining Homework 4

This repository contains the fourth practical homework for the Data Mining course, focusing on data preprocessing, regression, and classification tasks with machine learning.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.

## Homework Overview:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- The task involves loading data, handling missing values, and scaling features using methods like Min-Max scaling.
- Encoding categorical variables and normalizing data are essential preprocessing steps.

### 2. Regression Models:
- Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression are used to predict a target variable based on the features.
- Evaluation metrics for regression models include **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.

### 3. Classification Models:
- Classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied to classify the data.
- Classifier performance is evaluated based on **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rezaeim748/Data-Mining-course.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DM_HW4_Practical.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each task.
