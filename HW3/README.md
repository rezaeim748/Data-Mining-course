# Data Mining Homework 3

This repository contains the third practical homework for the Data Mining course, focusing on data preprocessing, regression, and classification tasks using machine learning libraries.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: For deep learning tasks.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.

## Homework Overview:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- The notebook starts with loading essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and others for data manipulation, processing, and visualization.
- It involves preprocessing tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features using methods like Min-Max scaling.

### 2. Regression Models:
- Linear and Polynomial Regression models are used to predict the target variable based on the given features.
- The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.

### 3. Classification Models:
- Various classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied to classify data.
- The evaluation of the classifiers is based on metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.

### 4. Additional Models:
- The homework includes the application of deep learning models using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** for more advanced tasks.
