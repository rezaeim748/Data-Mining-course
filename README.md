# Data Mining Course Homeworks

This repository contains a collection of practical homework assignments developed as part of the **Data Mining Course**. The assignments focus on various data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms, including data preprocessing, regression, classification, and model evaluation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Homework 1**: Data exploration and preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and basic feature engineering.
- **Homework 2**: Regression and classification tasks using techniques such as Linear/Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Homework 3**: Advanced classification using deep learning models (TensorFlow & PyTorch) and model evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Homework 4**: Statistical modeling and further classification using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM, with evaluation based on metrics such as MSE and accuracy.

## How to Run

Each homework folder contains its own README file with detailed instructions for running the respective assignments. Please refer to those for guidance on setup and execution.
